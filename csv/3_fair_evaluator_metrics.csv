0,f1_unique_identifier,https://w3id.org/FAIR_Tests/tests/gen2_unique_identifier,F1,Unique Identifier,Metric to test if the metadata resource has a unique identifier.  This is done by comparing the GUID to the patterns (by regexp) of known GUID schemas such as URLs and DOIs.  Known schema are registered in FAIRSharing (https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema)

Known schema are registered in FAIRSharing (https://fairsharing.org/standards/?q=&selected_facets=type_exact:identifier%20schema). For URLs that don't follow a schema in FAIRSharing we test known URL persistence schemas (purl, oclc, fdlp, purlz, w3id, ark).  "

4,f2_grounded_metadata,https://w3id.org/FAIR_Tests/tests/gen2_grounded_metadata,F2,Grounded Metadata,"Tests whether a machine is able to find 'grounded' metadata.  i.e. metadata terms that are in a resolvable namespace, where resolution leads to a definition of the meaning of the term. Examples include JSON-LD, embedded schema, or any form of RDF. This test currently excludes XML, even when terms are namespaced.  Future versions of this test may be more flexible."
5,a1.2_data_authorization,https://w3id.org/FAIR_Tests/tests/gen2_data_authorization,A1.2,Data authentication and authorization,"Test a discovered data GUID for the ability to implement authentication and authorization in its resolution protocol.  Currently passes InChI Keys, DOIs, Handles, and URLs.  It also searches the metadata for the Dublin Core 'accessRights' property, which may point to a document describing the data access process. Recognition of other identifiers will be added upon request by the community."

This particular test takes a broad view of what defines a 'knowledge representation language'; in this evaluation, a knowledge representation language is interpreted as one in which terms are semantically-grounded in ontologies.

This is done using a variety of 'scraping' tools, including DOI metadata resolution, the use of the 'extruct' Python tool, and others.

20,i2_metadata_uses_fair_vocabularies_weak,https://w3id.org/FAIR_Tests/tests/gen2_metadata_uses_fair_vocabularies_weak,I2,Metadata uses FAIR vocabularies (weak),"Maturity Indicator to test if the linked data metadata uses terms that resolve.  One predicate from each hostname is tested as 'representative' of the remainder from that hostname, in alphabetical order.  This tests only if they resolve, not if they resolve to FAIR data, therefore is a somewhat weak test. "
